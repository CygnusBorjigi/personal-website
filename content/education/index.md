I am in the class of 2023 at Boston University. I started my college life as a Math major, focusing onlearning about Set Theory. In the second half of my sofemore year, I learned about context free grammar and formal semetics, which ultimatlly lead me to switch my major to Computer Science and choose the path of the Theortical Computer Science. However, after extensive conversations with a few of my professors, I have decisided not to presue a carrer in academa. 

Currently, I am trying to prepare myself for a life in industry and I am studying for a role in Solution Architect.
