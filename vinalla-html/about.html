            I was born and raised in Beijing, China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, until I was 14. I currently live in the Boston Metro area in the U.S. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on Green Card and expect to become a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2025.

            I am a student at Boston University in the class of 2023, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. For the past three years, I have focused on theoretical Computer Science, mainly learning about formal semantics and context-free grammar, with the goal of entering a Ph.D. program in Computer Science after graduation. However, earlier this year, I made the decision to transition away from an academia focused study toward an industry focused study. I am currently studying to become a Cloud Solution Architect.

            So far, I have obtained three certifications from AWS, Cloud Practitioner, Solution Architect Associate, and Developer Associate.
